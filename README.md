# mc_simulation

This project was a requirement as part of my second year at ENSAE Paris.

It explores the pricing of options using different simulations methods.
The focus is set on QMC and Low Discrepency suits to simulate appropriately the path of a geometric brownian motion.

Every necessary element is included in the Jupyter notebook file. It does not really on any specific Python packages, only Numpy and Matplotlib.
